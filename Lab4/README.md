## Memory Management in a Linux Environment

Implement two memory allocation algorithms: best fita nd worst fit, andp erform analysis to determine which is better.

For each algorithm, a memory initialization function is implemented, which requests a chunk of free memory dynamically from the system to be managed by different allocation algorithms. Then, an allocation and deallocation function are implemented. One utility function is also to be implemented to help analyze the fficiency of the allocation algorithm and its implementation. A series of tests is then to be written to test the correctness of the implementations.

### Memory initialization functions:
<strong>best_fit_memory_init, worst_fit_memory_init</strong> - Initialize dynamic memory to be managed
