Hello,

Enclosed in this file are some details you may require while evaluating this lab project.

1. The stack size fixed during the prelab was 1024 bytes - when running Jonathan's second lab hint from learn (which was supposed to result in approximately 98-99% stack usage), we expected a value around half of that stack usage, as we believe that our fixed stack size for each task is double the size he used.

That should be all in terms of any details that you will require prior to evaluating this lab, thank you for your time.
